async.go.js
=================
This module is an NPM package that allows easy integration of asynchronous
libraries with the <a href="https://github.com/caolan/async">async.js</a> library.

By itself, this library really doesn't do anything.  It is intended to be used
as a dependency of other libraries that wish to turn their asynchronous API into
a better interface with <a href="https://github.com/caolan/async">Async.js</a>.

For example integrations, please see <a href="https://github.com/travist/jquery.go.js">jquery.go.js</a>
or <a href="https://github.com/travist/drupal.go.js">drupal.go.js</a>
